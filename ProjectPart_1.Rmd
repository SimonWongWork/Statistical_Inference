##Synopsis
In this project, students are required to use simulation to explore inference and
do some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.

Simulation of exponential distribution in R  will be used to compare with the Central Limit
Theorem.
The distribution of averages of 40 exponentials will be studied in this project:
1. The sample mean of the distribution of average of 40 exponentials will be compared with the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. The variance of the sample as compared with the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Showing the distribution is approximately normal.
